**E**nvironmental **D**ata **E**xplorer (EDE) is a application that allows analysing environmental data-collections. Data collections consist of data organized around a common theme and may include several related datasets, for example water chemistry and precipitation data. Environmenal data is being commonly published as open data. However, preparing this data in order to analyse and explore it still takes data management expertise and time. EDE allows to integrate such data and then analyse it using statistics and plots. In EDE, the information of each dataset is grouped in the following categories:

* General metadata on the data collection, including a description of the data collection, metadata from and reference to the data owner as well as a summary of the number of samples, parameters, stations etc covered by each dataset in the data collection.
* Summary tables on the station information;
* summary tables on the parameters measured;
* a plotting utility, alowing the user to visualize the data using various plot types.

Currently EDE includes three datasets:

* [Groundwater quality data from the Ontario Monitoring Network](https://www.ontario.ca/data/provincial-groundwater-monitoring-network), published by Ontario.ca.
* [Surface water quality from the Ontario Surface water Monitoring Network](https://www.ontario.ca/data/provincial-stream-water-quality-monitoring-network), published by Ontario.ca.
* [Arsenic groundwater contamination in Bangladesh](https://www.bgs.ac.uk/arsenic/bangladesh/), published by the British Geological Survey.

EDE is designed to allow easy addition of further data collections.
