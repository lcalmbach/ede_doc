Environmental Data Explorer (EDE) is a application that allows analysing environmental data-collections. Data collections is data organized around a common theme and may include several related datasets, for example water chemistry and precipitation. Environmenal data is beeing commonly published as open data. However, preparing this data in order to analyse and make sense of it still takes a lot of expertise and time. EDE allows to integrate such data and then analyse it using tables and plots. In EDE, the information of each dataset is grouped in the following categories:

* Provide general metadata on the data collection, including a description of the data collection, metadata from and reference to the data owner as well as a summary of the number of samples, parmaeters, stations etc covered by each dataset in the data collection
* Summary tables on the station information
* Summary tables on the parameters measured 
* A plotting utility, alowing the user to visualize the data using various plot types

Currently EDE includes two datasets, both published by Ontario.ca:

* [Groundwater quality data from the Ontario Monitoring Network](https://www.ontario.ca/data/provincial-groundwater-monitoring-network)
* [Surface water quality from the Ontario Surface water Monitoring Network](https://www.ontario.ca/data/provincial-stream-water-quality-monitoring-network)

EDE is designed to allow easy addition of further data collections.
